# Knowledge Crypto

Knowledge Crypto is a web application designed to provide real-time information on various cryptocurrencies. The application features a clean and responsive design, allowing users to view essential details about different coins, including their prices, market cap, and historical trends.

# Inspiration
I’ve always been interested in cryptocurrencies, but I often felt confused by all the information out there. I created Knowledge Crypto because I wanted an easy way to see the most important details—like prices, market cap, and trends—without getting lost in too much data.

This app is something I built to help myself and others find the information we need quickly and easily. I wanted to make it simple for anyone to understand what's happening in the crypto world, even if they’re new to it.

# Technology
This CRUD web app was built using a Flask backend with REST API to manage app routes and process GET/POST requests. I also integrated an SQLAlchemy database to store the user's food items and important values associated with it. Furthermore, I utilized HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive front-end comptaible with desktops, tablets and phones.
