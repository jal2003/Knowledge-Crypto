# Inspiration
I’ve always been interested in cryptocurrencies, but I often felt confused by all the information out there. I created Knowledge Crypto because I wanted an easy way to see the most important details—like prices, market cap, and trends—without getting lost in too much data.

This app is something I built to help myself and others find the information we need quickly and easily. I wanted to make it simple for anyone to understand what's happening in the crypto world, even if they’re new to it.
